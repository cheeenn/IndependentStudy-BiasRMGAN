# IndependentStudy-BiasRMGAN

this file is used to record all the code I use for my CSE 500 independent study.

1. infogan.py is the code Nando offer to me, with this code, I could use MNIST dataset to see how latent code will affect the features.

2. data_loader.py is the code from StarGAN, to preprocess the celebA dataset, and use it in StarGAN model.

Task for Sep.3 :
    Use data_loader.py to change the dataset of infoGAN, and there is a reference:
    https://github.com/taeoh-kim/Pytorch_InfoGAN about use CelebA in infoGAN.
